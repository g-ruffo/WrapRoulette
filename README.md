# Wrap Roulette

It's time to "put your money where your mouth is" and bet on the wrap time for your production. 

Built using Kotlin, Wrap Roulette is an Android application which allows coworkers to create and/or join daily pools where they try to predict when their work day will end. Each pool provides a private chat messenger for player communication. When wrap is called, the day's winner(s) is/are determined, according to set rules, and displayed for everyone to see.

## Features
- Create and customize your account and profile
- Join, create and edit pools
- Chat using the pool's private messenger
- Place and/or view other pool members' bets 
- Determine the winner(s) based on set rules
- View a summary of all your past and upcoming pools
